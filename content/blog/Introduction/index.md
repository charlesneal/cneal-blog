Okay, I know I am really late getting into this whole blogging
thing, but I still have a few years left in me and thought I might
actually try to learn something new.  Perhaps I'll be able to come
up with some interesting, humorous, educational topics to talk about
along the way.

A little about me... First I have to say, I have a really good life
and so much to be thankful for.  I have a wonderful, beautiful wife
and six kids between us as well as eight grand-children.  We also
have three dogs; Coco, Goliath, and Twix.

I am from Tampa, FL, but got to travel some since my Dad was in the
Air Force.  I got to live in Florida, Ohio, Texas, England, and the
Philipeans.  I went to college in Wichita Falls, TX, and graduated
from Midwestern State University with a B.S. in Computer Science.  
After graduation I got my first professional job working for Halliburton
and have been working for them now for over 30 years.  

Now being over 50 years old, working in an industry that is cyclical, 
the fear of being laid off and having to find another job at my age is
a huge concern.  I feel like I should be planning in case this happens 
at some point before I'm ready to retire. The problem is what would I do? 
I'm at a point where a career change might be what I need, and maybe, want 
to do.  

In these blogs, I'll start exploring some careers that I, or others in my 
situation, might consider.  I'm pretty sure I'm not along in this.  Hopefully, 
the perfect job or career will become evident and I'll/we'll be prepared.
