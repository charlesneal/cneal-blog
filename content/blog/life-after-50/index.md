Okay, I'll admit it, I'm over 50.  I may have a few aches and pains 
I didn't use to have, but I sure don't feel old inside.  Despite being 
long in the tooth, I have been able to learn new technologies and computer
languages at work and am currently on a journey to learn how to become a
full-stack web developer.  I'm actually excited about this, but am a bit
overwhelmed at how much is out there to learn and how quickly new libraries 
and frameworks are coming out.

I'm going to take some time explaining what I'm learning, frustrations I'm 
having, and the resources I am using to try to learn.  In the upcoming blog posts 
I'll be covering my journey on trying to become a web developer.  A great quote
about such a career the following:

[becoming a web developer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

Here are just a few things I'm learning:

> HTML, CSS, Javascript
> React, Bootstrap, Node, Express, React-Router, Styled Components
> Gatsby, Netlify, MongoDB, Postgresql, VSCode, Markdown, Typescript
>
